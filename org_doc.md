Introduction

The purpose of the Delaware School Choice Sherpa project is to assist parents navigating the school choice process in Delaware. School Choice in Delaware is complex. Each household in Delaware is assigned a feeder pattern school. The assigned feeder pattern school is the public school children are designated to attend. If a parent decides not to go through the school choice process the feeder pattern school  this is where a child will be educated. In Delaware, however, parents are eligible to apply to choice their children to any public school or charter school in the state as long as that school has space. If this sounds confusing, you are in the right place. The content and tools contained on the School choice Sherpa wil explain the steps of the school choice process and provide information to parents to help them chose the school that is right for their child.
