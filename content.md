# Introduction

School choice in Delaware is complex. Each Delaware household falls within a school district. The boundaries of each school district are also referred to as a feeder pattern. Unless, you, as a parent decides to send your child to a private school, charter school, or chooses to have your child attend a different public school, your child will attend their designated feeder pattern school. That is a big if, though, because of all the options you have as a parent. As a Delaware citizen your child is eligible to apply to attend any public school or charter school in the state. If this sounds confusing, you are in the right place. The purpose of the Delaware School Choice Sherpa project is to assist you and other Delaware parents navigate Delaware's school choice process. The content and tools  on this website explain the steps of the school choice process and provide information to help you choose the school that is right for your child. 

# What is a feeder school?

Each household in Delaware is assigned a feeder pattern school. The assigned feeder pattern school is the public school children are designated to attend. If a parent decides not to go through the school choice process the feeder pattern school this is where a child will be educated.

# What is a school choice?

The Delaware School Choice program offers a parent or guardian the opportunity to apply to schools of their choice in the case that the child's feeder school is not an appropriate fit for the child. Parents and guardians can choose to apply for their child to attend a traditional school outside of their feeder pattern, a charter school, a magnet school, a vo-tech school or a private school.

# What is a charter school? 
Charter schools are independent, tuition-free public schools, serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The “charter” establishing each school is a contract, which states the school’s mission, program and measurable goals. Charter schools may be authorized by the State Department of Education or a local school district. They are accountable to their authorizer, parents and the public. Charter schools are different from traditional public schools in that they can only remain open as long as they deliver the results that they promise.

# Step 1. Find a School

Begin by researching schools. Review the school choice guide and look for schools that match your student’s priorities (related to academics and training, extracurriculars, preferences, diversity, and transportation). 

Visit schools that interest you and your student.

Rank school choices. Consider each school’s capacity. What to consider?
- Academics and Training: What/how will your child learn and will the environment work for them? (Student Special Needs, Special Programs, Equipment, Technology) 
- Preferences: Do you meet special considerations and will it affect your chance of admission? (Seat Capacity/Rejection Risk, School Proximity)
- Diversity: How might the staff/student population impact your child’s success? (Cultural/Social Comfort, Staff/Faculty)
- Transportation: How will your child get to/from school? (School Bus, Walking or Private Vehicle, Public Transportation)
- Extracurriculars: What kind of non-academic offerings does the school have? (Arts, Sports Club)
