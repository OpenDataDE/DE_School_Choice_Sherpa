Parents interested in applying to a district, charter school or career and technical education school should visit their website for information about the school and/or program and submission of a standard application form and any other supplemental application if required.
The State of Delaware maintains a standard school choice application. The standard application can be submitted to either the Department of Education or the local school district on or after the first Monday in November and on or before the second Wednesday in January. Each school district is mandated by Delaware state law to have a written policy that details the criteria by which applications are evaluated and the priority assigned to those criteria. Charter schools, vocational-technical school districts, and magnet schools may continue to accept applications after the second Wednesday in January to fill remaining availability; however, those holding a lottery, will include applications received by the second Wednesday in January.
School Choice Opens!
Districts are not allowed to request supplemental application information from students outside the district that they do not require from from inside the district. After selecting students based on acceptable information, districts must use a lottery system. District’s are not allowed to reject applications of students with special needs. All receiving local education agencies are required to use and accept the standard application form provided by the Delaware Department of Education (DDOE).
